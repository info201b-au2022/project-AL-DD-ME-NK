## Abstract

Our main question is whether certain groups are more likely to be victims of the use of force by police. This question is important because it holds police departments accountable for their actions and also helps identify causes and solutions to address the problem. To address the question, we will be analyzing the data sets of different police departments regarding the use of force to identify trends. We are concerned with the use of force by police because it is a widely debated topic of national concern. To address this concern, we plan to find possible causes that result in groups facing the use of force by law enforcement at an irregularly high rate.

## Introduction

The use of force by police is sometimes inevitable in certain situations in order to protect officers and the public. However, the improper use of force can result in significant consequences for the victims and the police officers involved. Our project will investigate the use-of-force incidents involving law enforcement through a nationwide lense. The purpose of this data is to show an overall perspective of the incidents reported, circumstances, subjects, and officers involved. This is because the excessive use of force by law enforcement has become a topic of national concern in recent years. By investigating the data, we hope to promote more transparency and accountability for police. The project will investigate trends in the use of force by law enforcement across multiple police departments in the country to identify possible causes or factors that may increase the likelihood of force being applied.

## Problem Domain

    The problem that needs to be addressed is how to create a law enforcement system where the use of force is justified in protecting the public, but does not infringe an individual's rights or oppress groups. The question presented is whether human rights are being violated through the use of force by law enforcement in certain situations. In addition, the question of whether law enforcement is protecting the weak from oppression or if they are contributing to the problem by targeting certain groups is also part of the issue. These groups may include minorities or people with disabilities.\
    The human values that are connected to the problem are the integrity of law enforcement and the equal treatment of all individuals. The debate of whether those who are seen as a symbol of power in society are utilizing their power justly has become an increasingly controversial topic. This has originated from multiple recorded incidents showcasing police brutality. Value tensions have formed between the standards of when situations require the use of force by law enforcement to protect the public and when it is used in a way that violates human rights.\
    The direct stakeholders involved are those who are victims of the use of force by law enforcement and members of law enforcement. Law enforcement has the main responsibility of protecting the public and determining when the use of force is necessary. However, the individuals who experience the use of force by law enforcement also have the right to be treated fairly. The indirect stakeholders are the media and those who are influenced by the media. The values that indirect stakeholders hold are to ensure that those in positions of power do not abuse their power.\
    The potential benefits from intervention with technology is that law enforcement will become more transparent with the public. Incidents that involve the use of force are publicly displayed with the details to ensure victims were treated equally. Both direct and indirect stakeholders will benefit from a transparent system as it holds law enforcement accountable while also keeping the public safe. The harm is that not every situation can be fully explained in detail through datasets. Information that the public obtains is reliant on the information that police departments release about the events. This can result in mis-communication between law enforcement and the public.

## Research Questions

1.  **Do certain groups have higher rates of being victims of the use of force by police?** This is important as it increases the divide between groups in society. Research has consistently shown that minorities feel that they are more likely to be singled out by police and have higher rates of distrust towards law enforcement.
2.  **Does officer experience and training correlate with the frequency of force being used?** Investigating whether law enforcement is properly trained is important in understanding whether training is playing a significant role in the rates of incidents involving the use of force. The question arises whether officers that lack experience may be more likely to resort to force to handle a situation.
3.  **What outside factors increase the chances of force being used?** Exploring factors that may increase the risk of force being used can help address the situation by finding solutions to fix the causes. The federal government can fund the establishment of institutions that state governments may not be able to afford.

## The Dataset

### Relation to Problem Domain

Our datasets are related to our problem domain because they provide information on incidents involving the use of force from large police departments across the country. They provide detail on the officers, the type of force used, and also the victims. Some information include gender, age, race, experience, ect. We will be able to answer our research questions using these datasets because we can analyze factors and characteristics of individuals to evaluate whether certain groups account for a higher percentage of incidents. In addition, outside factors like the mental status of individuals and drugs are recorded which will allow us to see if they play a significant role. Furthermore, the experience of officers will allow us to evaluate whether experience and training plays a role in the number of incidents that involve the use of force.

### Provenance of Dataset

a)  The data was collected by the New Orleans Police Department, Dallas Police Department, and the City of Seattle. The data for the New Orleans Police Department data is collected daily since October of 2016, the Dallas Police Department data only contains the data from 2020, and the Seattle Police Department data has been collected since June of 2014. The purpose of police departments collecting data and making them public is to be transparent with the public around policy, process, and training in the use of force by officers. A key goal of the police departments is the goal of maintaining public trust which they hope to sustain through the release of the records. They hope that greater transparency will allow police departments to work with communities to gain their support in policies and practices.

b)  The collection of data is usually funded by state and local governments, but sometimes they will receive funding from the federal government. Both the police departments and the public benefit from the data collected on the use of force. The police departments are able to gain the trust of their communities while the public are able to hold police departments accountable.

c)  The data is collected and validated by the individual police departments. They are stored in public databases that allow anyone to download the data. The datasets are trustworthy and credible because they are collected directly from the primary source and not from a secondary source such as another organization or institution.

d)  We were able to obtain the data by looking up public databases from police departments around the country. Some police departments have records of use of force incidents that are available for the public to download. We credit the source of the data because each police department has a thorough investigation into the details for every incident that involves the use of force.

## Findings

**Do certain groups have higher rates of being victims of the use of force by police?**\
Based off the pie chart, we are able to determine that Whites account for the highest percentage of incidents
involving the use of force with Blacks or African Americans accounting for the second highest percentage of incidents. This trend is consistent across many years. However, we are unable to view the data based on percentage alone. We must take into account the proportion of the US population that is accounted for by Whites and Blacks or African Americans. According to the United States Census Bureau, Whites are estimated to account for 75.8% of the US population and Blacks or African Americans account for only 13.6% of the US population (“QuickFacts: United States”). The large difference in proportion when the US population is taken into account indicates that Blacks or African Americans make up a disproportionate amount of incidents involving the use of force.

**Does officer experience and training correlate with the frequency of force being used?**
From the bar chart, we are able to conclude that officer experience does correlate with the frequency of force being used. Officers with more experience are less likely to be involved in incidents involving the use of force while officers with less experience are more likely. This may point to more training being needed for new officers to better prepare them for situations. There may also be a lack of supervision of new officers resulting in higher number of incidents involving the use of force by newer officers. The number of incidents seems to exponentially increase from zero to five years and peak at around five to ten years of experience, but decreases significantly after ten years.

**What outside factors increase the chances of force being used?**
Based off the area encoding chart, it can be seen that the most common factors that affect all groups include being agitated, mentally unstable, drugs, and alcohol. These are all problems that can be seen in the modern world as governments work to find solutions. From the chart it can also be determined that Blacks and Hispanics are the most likely to be affected by outside factors. Even though Blacks and Hispanics make up a significantly less proportion of the US population when compared to Whites, they are most heavily impacted. This can be drawn back to income inequality and established systems that contribute to the problem. 

## Discussion importance and implications
    Implications that can be seen from the data visualizations is a long sustained system of institutional racism from policymakers and the lack of initiative to address worsening issues. Minority groups face an abnormally higher rate of being involved in incidents that involve the use of force. The pie chart supports the implication that Blacks are much more likely to face the use of force by law enforcement. Although minority groups in the US account for a much smaller proportion of the US population, they represent a much larger percentage of victims being involved in incidents involving the use of force.

    The data visualizations also reveal a lack of initiative by government institutions to fund solutions for worsening issues. This leads to certain groups becoming more likely to be subjects of incidents involving the use of force with law enforcement. Some examples of groups include people who suffer from mental illness and drug addiction. This implies the government's lack of policy making that funds the establishment of programs that help address the issues such as rehabilitation programs and mental illness clinics. 

    Furthermore, officers with less experience are more likely to be involved in incidents involving the use of force. The data visualization supports the idea that there may be a lack of training or supervision of newer officers. Policies and training are not ensuring that every officer is fully trained on how to handle the situations they may face. A disproportionate number of incidents involving the use of force are caused by officers with less experience when compared to more experienced officers.

    These implications are important to take into account because they reveal the issues that not only law enforcement institutions face, but also possible larger issues within the government. The government may in fact have a larger effect on the trends that can be seen in the data visualizations. They are more likely to have the ability to change the trends that are seen compared to police departments because they have the ability to distribute funding. The funding can be more focused on creating solutions that will reduce the number of incidents with force involved rather than being ineffectively used. Possible solutions involve having a larger budget for adequate training and providing support for those in need.
