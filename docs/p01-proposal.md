## Abstract

Our main question is whether certain groups are more likely to be victims of the use of force by police. This question is important because it holds police departments accountable for their actions and also helps identify causes and solutions to address the problem. To address the question, we will be analyzing the data sets of different police departments regarding the use of force to identify trends. We are concerned with the use of force by police because it is a widely debated topic of national concern. To address this concern, we plan to find possible causes that result in groups facing the use of force by law enforcement at an irregularly high rate.

## Introduction

The use of force by police is sometimes inevitable in certain situations in order to protect officers and the public. However, the improper use of force can result in significant consequences for the victims and the police officers involved. Our project will investigate the use-of-force incidents involving law enforcement through a nationwide lense. The purpose of this data is to show an overall perspective of the incidents reported, circumstances, subjects, and officers involved. This is because the excessive use of force by law enforcement has become a topic of national concern in recent years. By investigating the data, we hope to promote more transparency and accountability for police. The project will investigate trends in the use of force by law enforcement across multiple police departments in the country to identify possible causes or factors that may increase the likelihood of force being applied.

## Problem Domain

    The problem that needs to be addressed is how to create a law enforcement system where the use of force is justified in protecting the public, but does not infringe an individual's rights or oppress groups. The question presented is whether human rights are being violated through the use of force by law enforcement in certain situations. In addition, the question of whether law enforcement is protecting the weak from oppression or if they are contributing to the problem by targeting certain groups is also part of the issue. These groups may include minorities or people with disabilities.\
    The human values that are connected to the problem are the integrity of law enforcement and the equal treatment of all individuals. The debate of whether those who are seen as a symbol of power in society are utilizing their power justly has become an increasingly controversial topic. This has originated from multiple recorded incidents showcasing police brutality. Value tensions have formed between the standards of when situations require the use of force by law enforcement to protect the public and when it is used in a way that violates human rights.\
    The direct stakeholders involved are those who are victims of the use of force by law enforcement and members of law enforcement. Law enforcement has the main responsibility of protecting the public and determining when the use of force is necessary. However, the individuals who experience the use of force by law enforcement also have the right to be treated fairly. The indirect stakeholders are the media and those who are influenced by the media. The values that indirect stakeholders hold are to ensure that those in positions of power do not abuse their power.\
    The potential benefits from intervention with technology is that law enforcement will become more transparent with the public. Incidents that involve the use of force are publicly displayed with the details to ensure victims were treated equally. Both direct and indirect stakeholders will benefit from a transparent system as it holds law enforcement accountable while also keeping the public safe. The harm is that not every situation can be fully explained in detail through datasets. Information that the public obtains is reliant on the information that police departments release about the events. This can result in mis-communication between law enforcement and the public.

## Research Questions

1.  Do certain groups have higher rates of being victims of the use of force by police? This is important as it increases the divide between groups in society. Research has consistently shown that minorities feel that they are more likely to be singled out by police and have higher rates of distrust towards law enforcement.\
2.  What outside factors increase the chances of force being used? Exploring factors that may increase the risk of force being used can help address the situation by finding solutions to fix the causes. The federal government can fund the establishment of institutions that state governments may not be able to afford.\
3.  Does officer experience and training affect the frequency of force being used? Investigating whether law enforcement is properly trained is important in understanding whether training is playing a significant role in the rates of incidents involving the use of force. The question arises whether officers that lack experience may be more likely to resort to force to handle a situation.

### Provenance of Dataset

## Expected Implications

A possible implication is the exposal of a long sustained system of institutional racism for policymakers. Minority groups may face an abnormally higher rate of being victims of the use of force by law enforcement. Although minority groups account for a significantly less percentage of the population, they represent a drastically higher rate of being victims of the use of force by law enforcement. In addition, it may reveal prejudice towards certain groups causing them to be more prone to the use of force by law enforcement. Examples include mental illness, age, gender, addicts, ect. This implies the lack of policy making in government to address the situation such as the establishing of programs to help those in need. Furthermore, officers with less experience may lack skills in defusing situations and resort to the use of force. Abnormally high rates of the use of force incidents by officers with less experience indicates a lack of sufficient training and testing.

## Limitations

A limitation that needs to be addressed is that we do not have the full context of each situation where the use of force had to be applied. There is no information given on whether the office was in real danger or whether the public was in danger. We are therefore unable to judge whether the use of force was necessary and whether it was justified. In addition, we are unable to determine whether there was an excessive use of force. Without the detailed context of every situation, we are also unable to judge whether an alternation solution was available to deescalate the situation.
